# Agentic-Chatbot

## Project Description 
This project is a full-stack web app that implements an Agentic AI Chatbot for Duke University. The chatbot is able to answer different questions about Duke's curriculum, events, and locations on campus. The front-end is implemented with React + Vite, while the backend is implemented with Flask. The backend is hosted on an EC2 Instance and receives queries from the frontend via a web socket that passes messages to the EC2 through Lambda functions. The backend utilizes LangChain to implement an agentic workflow and uses GPT-4o-mini as the LLM for the agents to process the queries. 

This chatbot is designed for incoming duke students or students considering applying to Duke University. Furthermore, the chatbot is meant to have a friendly and helpful tone that helps users retrieve the information they are looking for. Given that we students in the Duke AIPI program, the chatbot is more oriented towards answering questions about our program, but is able to answer questions about other programs and courses as well.
